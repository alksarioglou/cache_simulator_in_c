# Simulation of a Cache Memory Operation in C
- Simulating the operation of a **fully associative cache memory on an embedded processor using C**
- Using the simulation program, analysed the **performance of the cache when executing the cross correlation and the bubble sort algorithms**
- Exploring the **impact of the memory block size** on the cache speed and performance
